# 🌳 ShadeSync  
### 🏆 CMKL AI Innovator Award 2025 — **6th Place**

**ShadeSync** is a web application that helps users find **cooler walking routes** by prioritizing paths with **more surrounding shade**, helping reduce heat exposure and improve walking comfort in urban environments.

> ☀️ Walking smarter, not shorter.

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement
In hot cities, especially in tropical regions like Thailand, walking outdoors can be uncomfortable and even unsafe due to heat exposure.  
Most navigation apps optimize for **shortest or fastest routes**, but **ignore environmental comfort** such as shade coverage.

---

## 💡 Our Solution
ShadeSync analyzes satellite imagery and AI-based shadow detection to recommend **routes with higher shade coverage**, even if they are slightly longer — because comfort matters.

📊 From our survey:
> **81% of users prefer a longer route with more shade** over a shorter route with less shade.

---

## 🚶‍♂️ How It Works
1. User selects a start and destination point  
2. Multiple walking routes are generated  
3. Satellite imagery is analyzed using an AI model (U-Net)  
4. Shadow coverage along each route is calculated  
5. Routes are ranked based on **shade-to-distance ratio**
